Despite following expected trends, the local and global expansion\nrates are only weakly correlated. Finally, for those events with clearly\nidentifiable magnetic flux ropes, we investigate the orientation of the flux\nrope axis as they propagate; we find that 64% of events displayed a decrease in\ninclination with increasing heliocentric distance, and 40% of events undergo a\nsignificant change in orientation as they propagate towards Juno. The\nmulti-spacecraft catalogue produced in this study provides a valuable link\nbetween ICME observations in the inner heliosphere and beyond 1 AU, thereby\nimproving our understanding of ICME evolution.\n\n    "}

The effect is geometric in origin, as\nrelative shear on curved orbits moves their shared center-of-mass slightly\ninward and toward the external potential during a collapse, exchanging orbital\nangular momentum into aligned (prograde) rotation. We perform illustrative\nanalytical and N-body calculations to show that this process of prograde\nspin-up proceeds quadratically in time ($\\delta L_\\mathrm{rot} \\propto t^2$)\nuntil the collapse nears completion.

We\nresolve this issue by introducing a novel mechanism of conserving energy at\ntemporal metasurfaces in a non-linear setting. The idea is first demonstrated\nby considering a wave-packet propagating in a discrete medium of 1-d chain of\nsprings and masses, where using our energy conserving mechanism we show that\nthe spring stiffness can be incremented at several time interfaces and the\nenergy will still be conserved. We then consider an interesting application of\ntime-reversed imaging in 1-d and 2-d spring-mass systems with a wave packet\ntraveling in the homogenized regime. Our numerical simulations show that, in\n1-d, when the wave packet hits the time-interface two sets of waves are\ngenerated, one traveling forward in time and the other traveling backward. The\ntime-reversed waves re-converge at the location of the source and we observe\nits regeneration. In 2-d, we use more complicated initial shapes and, even\nthen, we observe regeneration of the original image or source. Thus, we achieve\ntime-reversed imaging with conservation of energy in a non-linear system. The\nenergy conserving mechanism can be easily extended to continuum media.\n\n    "}

The WKB reformulation\nfor the backward equation is Varadhan's discrete nonlinear semigroup and is\nalso a monotone scheme which approximates the limiting first order\nHamiltonian-Jacobi equations(HJE). Then the maximality and monotonicity of the\ndiscrete Hamiltonian leads to a m-accretive operator, which generates a\nnonlinear semigroup on countable grids. From this, we obtain the wellposedness\nof CME and the backward equation with `no reaction' boundary conditions. The\nconvergence from the monotone schemes to the viscosity solution of HJE is\nproved via the upper/lower semicontinuous envelopes of the discrete resolvent\nproblem and nonlinear semigroup theory.

Our\ngoal is to provide testable predictions that can be used to differentiate\nbetween properties arising from solar surface processes and those from the\nin-situ evolution of Alfv\u00e9n waves in switchback observations by PSP.

Many prior\nexperimental and numerical studies show that this phenomenon results in a\nchaotic flow field inside a microdevice, thereby facilitating the mixing of two\nfluids if they are Newtonian in behaviour. However, the present numerical study\nshows that this chaotic convection arising due to the electrokinetic\ninstability can be suppressed if the fluids are viscoelastic instead of\nNewtonian ones. In particular, we observe that as the Weissenberg number (ratio\nof the elastic to that of the viscous forces) gradually increases and the\npolymer viscosity ratio (ratio of the solvent viscosity to that of the\nzero-shear rate viscosity of the polymeric solution) gradually decreases, the\nchaotic fluctuation inside a T microfluidic junction decreases within the\npresent range of conditions encompassed in this study. We demonstrate that this\nsuppression of the chaotic motion occurs due to the formation of a strand of\nhigh elastic stresses at the interface of the two fluids. We further show that\nthis suppression of the chaotic fluctuation (particularly the span-wise one)\ninhibits the mixing of two viscoelastic fluids. Therefore, one needs to be\ncautious when the EKI phenomenon is planned to use to mix such viscoelastic\nfluids. Our observations are in line with that seen in limited experimental\nstudies conducted for these kinds of viscoelastic fluids.\n\n    "}

In the limit of strongly magnetized plasma, it is typically\nmodeled by Spitzer's expression where the heat flux is aligned with the\nmagnetic field. This paper describes the implementation of the heat conduction\ninto the code MANCHA3D with an aim of extending single-fluid MHD simulations\nfrom the upper convection zone into the solar corona. Two different schemes to\nmodel heat conduction are implemented: (1) a standard scheme where a parabolic\nterm is added to the energy equation, and (2) a scheme where the hyperbolic\nheat flux equation is solved. The first scheme limits the time step due to the\nexplicit integration of a parabolic term, which makes the simulations\ncomputationally expensive. The second scheme solves the limitations on the time\nstep by artificially limiting the heat conduction speed to computationally\nmanageable values. The validation of both schemes is carried out with standard\ntests in one, two, and three spatial dimensions. Furthermore, we implement the\nmodel for heat flux derived by Braginskii (1965) in its most general form, when\nthe expression for the heat flux depends on the ratio of the collisional to\ncyclotron frequencies of the plasma, and, therefore on the magnetic field\nstrength.

The model also\ntransitions smoothly between field-aligned conductivity and isotropic\nconductivity for regions with a low or null magnetic field. Finally, we present\na two-dimensional test for heat conduction using realistic values of the solar\natmosphere where we prove the robustness of the two schemes implemented.\n\n    "}

We show how general,\ncounter-intuitive and negative for inference, is the problem of the\nimpossibility to estimate the distance from equilibrium using a series of\nscalar data which have a Gaussian statistics. This impossibility occurs also\nwhen the data are correlated in time, and that is the most interesting case\nbecause it usually stems from a multi-dimensional linear Markovian system where\nthere are many time-scales associated to different variables and, possibly,\nthermal baths.

We\nbegin here by summarizing these unique RQM features, with a focus on those that\nsuggest altered insights into the nature of the randomness exhibited in QM\nphenomena. One of these RQM features is the assumption that all objects in the\nuniverse are quantum objects, regardless of their material complexity. And, the\ninteraction of any two objects can result in new relational quantum states of\neach of the objects with the other as reference. But such new states do not\nreplace relational states corresponding to previous interactions with other\nreference objects. In particular, such earlier relational states that include a\nvariable considered to be random do not collapse to define a determined value\nof the variable, but instead simply take on that specific value in the state\nrelative to the new reference. The concept of randomness associated with\nquantum state variables in RQM thus differs from that in other QM\ninterpretations. Rather than take the usual pedantic approach of elaborate\nside-by-side comparisons between the RQM and other common QM interpretations,\nwe illustrate these differences by describing in some detail the well-known\n\"dual-slit\" experiment in terms of RQM concepts, pointing out the important\nadvantages over other interpretations along the way.

In this paper, we propose an\nall-photonic artificial neural network processor wherein information is encoded\nin the amplitudes of frequency modes that act as neurons. The weights among\nconnected layers are encoded in the amplitude of controlled frequency modes\nthat act as pumps. Interaction among these modes for information processing is\nenabled by non-linear optical processes. Both the matrix multiplication and\nelement-wise activation functions are performed through coherent processes,\nenabling the direct representation of negative and complex numbers without the\nuse of detectors or digital electronics. Via numerical simulations, we show\nthat our design achieves a performance commensurate with present-day\nstate-of-the-art computational networks on image-classification benchmarks. Our\narchitecture is unique in providing a completely unitary, reversible mode of\ncomputation. Additionally, the computational speed increases with the power of\nthe pumps to arbitrarily high rates, as long as the circuitry can sustain the\nhigher optical power.\n\n    "}

Kesner"], "abstraction": "  AIMS: Clinical radiographic imaging is seated upon the principle of\ndifferential keV photon transmission through an object. At clinical x-ray\nenergies the scattering of photons causes signal noise and is utilized solely\nfor transmission measurements. However, scatter - particularly Compton scatter,\nis characterizable. In this work we hypothesized that modern radiation sources\nand detectors paired with deep learning techniques can use scattered photon\ninformation constructively to resolve superimposed attenuators in planar x-ray\nimaging. METHODS: We simulated a monoenergetic x-ray imaging system consisting\nof a pencil beam x-ray source directed at an imaging target positioned in front\nof a high spatial- and energy-resolution detector array. The signal was\nanalyzed by a convolutional neural network, and a description of scattering\nmaterial along the axis of the beam was derived. The system was virtually\ndesigned/tested using Monte Carlo processing of simple phantoms consisting of\n10 pseudo-randomly stacked air/bone/water materials, and the network was\ntrained by solving a classification problem. RESULTS: The average accuracy of\nthe material identification along the beam was 0.91 +- 0.01, with slightly\nhigher accuracy towards the entrance/exit peripheral surfaces of the object.\nThe average sensitivity and specificity was 0.91 and 0.95, respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our work provides proof of principle that deep learning techniques\ncan be used to analyze scattered photon patterns which can constructively\ncontribute to the information content in radiography, here used to infer depth\ninformation in a traditional 2D planar setup. This principle, and our results,\ndemonstrate that the information in Compton scattered photons may provide a\nbasis for further development. The ability to scale performance to the clinic\nremains unexplored and requires further study.\n\n    "}

{"title": "On the structure of Vorticity and Turbulence Fields in a separated flow  around a finite wing; analysis using Direct Numerical Simulation", "authors": ["Juan Carlos Bilbao-Ludena", "George Papadakis"], "abstraction": "  We investigate the spatial distributions and production mechanisms of\nvorticity and turbulent kinetic energy around a finite NACA 0018 wing with\nsquare wingtip profile at $Re_c=10^4$ and $10^{\\circ}$ angle of attack with the\naid of Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS). The analysis focuses on the highly\ninhomogeneous region around the tip and the near wake; this region is highly\nconvoluted, strongly three-dimensional, and far from being self-similar. The\nflow separates close to the leading edge creating a large, open recirculation\nzone around the central part of the wing. In the proximity of the tip, the flow\nremains attached but another smaller recirculation zone forms closer to the\ntrailing edge; this zone strongly affects the development of main wing tip\nvortex. The early formation mechanisms of three vortices close to the leading\nedge are elucidated and discussed. More specifically, we analyse the role of\nvortex stretching/compression and tilting, and how it affects the strength of\neach vortex as it approaches the trailing edge. We find that the\nthree-dimensional flow separation at the sharp tip close to the leading edge\nplays an important role on the subsequent vortical flow development on the\nsuction side. The production of turbulent kinetic energy and Reynolds stresses\nis also investigated and discussed in conjunction with the identified vortex\npatterns.

Our\nwork reveals that, in contrast to steady shear flows, in which small\norientational fluctuations from a flow-aligned state initiate tumbling and\ndeformations, the periodic flow reversal allows the filament to explore many\ndifferent configurations at the beginning of each cycle. Investigation of\nfilament motion during half time periods of oscillation highlights the critical\nrole of the initial filament orientation on the emergent dynamics.

Two\narchitectural models were used: 1.) randomly distributed capillaries and 2.)\ncapillaries forming a regular square lattice array. The resulting oxygen\npartial pressure distribution histograms were used to simulate normal and\ntumour tissue cell survival using the linear quadratic model of cell survival,\nmodified to incorporate oxygen-enhancement ratio (OER) effects.

Second, we demonstrate that such Dirichlet priors can be incorporated\nwithin an hierarchical modeling of the prior uncertainty in the isotopic\nvector, when prior information about isotopic composition is available. Our\nused Bayesian hierarchical modeling framework makes use of this available\ninformation but also acknowledges its uncertainty by letting to a controlled\nextent the information content of the indirect measurement data (i.e., gamma\nand neutron counts) shape the actual prior distribution of the isotopic vector.\nThird, we propose to regularize the Bayesian inversion by using Gaussian\nprocess (GP) prior modeling when inferring 1D spatially-distributed quantities.\nAs of uncertainty in the efficiencies, we keep using the same stylized drum\nmodeling approach as proposed in our previous work to account for the source\ndistribution uncertainty across the vertical direction of the drum. A series of\nsynthetic tests followed by application to a real waste drum show that\ncombining hierarchical modeling of the prior isotopic composition uncertainty\ntogether with GP prior modeling of the vertical Pu profile across the drum\nworks well.

Numerical and\ntheoretical analyses reveal that both the symmetries of the surface and pattern\nparticipate in the initiation of pattern propagation. This study provides a\nnovel and generic mechanism of pattern propagation that is caused by surface\ncurvature, as well as insights into the general role of surface geometry.\n\n    "}

A natural question is that whether CMR works elsewhere in the Galaxy. As\nan initial attempt to answer the question, this paper investigates the\ntriggering of CMR and the production of dense gas in a flat-rotating disk with\na modified BiSymmetric Spiral (BSS) magnetic field. Cloud-cloud collisions at\nfield reversals in the disk are modeled with the Athena++ code. Under the\ncondition that is representative of the warm neutral medium, the cloud-cloud\ncollision successfully triggers CMR at different disk radii. However, dense gas\nformation is hindered by the dominating thermal pressure, unless a moderately\nstronger initial field $\\gtrsim5\\mu$G is present. The strong-field model,\nhaving a larger Lundquist number $S_L$ and lower plasma $\\beta$, activates the\nplasmoid instability in the collision midplane, which is otherwise suppressed\nby the disk rotation. We speculate that CMR can be common if more clouds\ncollide along field reversals. However, to witness the CMR process in numerical\nsimulations, we need to significantly resolve the collision midplane with a\nspatial dynamic range $\\gtrsim10^6$. If Milky Way spiral arms indeed coincide\nwith field reversals in BSS, it is possible that CMR creates or maintains dense\ngas in the arms. High-resolution, high-sensitivity Zeeman/Faraday-Rotation\nobservations are crucial for finding CMR candidates that have helical fields.\n\n    "}

This interaction may occur either directly due to excitation of\na transiently growing perturbation or indirectly due to destabilization of the\nR-S by turbulent Reynolds stresses. A fundamental distinction between the\ndirect and the indirect mechanisms, which is central to understanding the\nphysics of turbulence, is that in the direct mechanism the R-S is itself the\ngrowing structure while in the indirect mechanism the R-S emerges as a\nself-organized structure.

In the present work, we focus on the\nform, a specific aspect of the overall shape, of sedimentary grains in order to\ninvestigate and quantify its effect on porosity, ultimately deriving novel\nporosity-prediction models. To this end, we develop a robust and accurate\nsimulation tool based on the discrete element method which we validate against\nlaboratory experiments. Utilizing digital representations of actual sediment\nfrom the Rhine river, we first study packings that are composed of particles\nwith a single form. There, the porosity is found to be mainly determined by the\ninverse equancy, i.e., the ratio of the longest to the smallest form-defining\naxis. Only for small ratios, additional shape-related properties become\nrelevant, as revealed by a direct comparison to packings of form-equivalent\nellipsoids. Since sediment naturally features form mixtures, we extend our\nsimulation tool to study sediment packings with normally-distributed forms.

By supplying additional information about a second\nform factor and the standard deviations, we derive an accurate model for\nporosity prediction.

Both real-world and experimentally simulated turbulence\nconditions have revealed that free-space structured light modes are perturbed\nin some manner by turbulence, resulting in both amplitude and phase\ndistortions.

In this thesis, ultra-thin-walled tubing\nrefers to tubing where the wall thicknesses are less than 500 $\\mu m$. Orbital\nwelding of tubing with this wall thickness requires both a sufficient heat\ninput to weld the tubing and an internal buttressing gas flow to ensure the\ntube retains its geometrical integrity. The specific use case is for the\ncommercially pure grade 2 titanium tubing used in the ATLAS ITk cooling system\nwhich is 2.275 $mm$ outer diameter and 300 $\\mu m$ wall thickness at the weld.\nThe solver is created using the open source computational fluid dynamics\nlibrary OpenFOAM and each component of the solver is benchmarked against an\nappropriate case. With the solver established, it is used to simulate a series\nof welding procedures that were performed experimentally on the aforementioned\ntitanium tubing. Both the experimental and simulation results show a\n`goldilocks' region where the weld heat input and inner buttressing gas flow\nare moderated to a level where a fully penetrating weld is created but the\ngeometric integrity of the tube is not compromised. gtawFoam is then used to\nsimulate hypothetical tubing with larger and smaller wall thicknesses between\n250 $\\mu m$ and 350 $\\mu m$. The results suggest that the required buttressing\ngas pressure once achieved is relatively transferable between wall thickness\nchanges but applying enough heat so as to achieve full penetration is critical.\nThese results are then used to predict effective welding procedures for this\nhypothetical tubing. gtawFoam is subsequently applied to the welding of turbine\nblades.

Reconstruction methods relying on deep learning have\nattracted a lot of attention recently due to their promising performance for a\nvariety of medical imaging modalities. There are, however, issues that preclude\ndirect application of such methods to CBCT in practice. Firstly, deep learning\nreconstruction methods become prohibitively memory expensive when working with\nfully 3D data such as CBCT. Secondly, deep learning reconstruction methods are\nwidely criticised for being trained and evaluated on data from a specific\nregion of interest such as thorax, raising concerns about generalization to\nother organs. In this work, we aim to address these shortcomings and propose\nLIRE: a fully learned, partially invertible primal-dual iterative scheme for\nCone Beam CT reconstruction. We drastically reduce memory footprint of the\nnetwork without sacrificing expressive power by combining reversible residual\nprimal-dual blocks together with patch-wise computations inside the blocks,\nwhich allows us to train using clinically-relevant resolutions and projection\ncounts on current consumer hardware. The models are trained on thorax CT scans\nand tested using both thorax CT and head \\& neck CT data. We demonstrate that\nLIRE outperforms the classical methods and the deep learning baseline on both\ntest sets.\n\n    "}

Thus at\nhigher Re the space averaged collision rate forms in rare regions where the\nassumption of smooth flow breaks down. We describe the transition between the\nregimes and provide collision kernel in the case of moderate Re describable by\nthe flow. The distribution of pairwise distances is shown to obey a separable\ndependence on the magnitude and the polar angle of the separation vector.\nMagnitude dependence obeys a power-law with a negative exponent, manifesting\nmultifractality of the droplet's attractor. We provide the so far missing\nnumerical confirmation of a relation between this exponent and the Lyapunov\nexponents and demonstrate that it holds beyond the theoretical range. The\nangular dependence of the RDF exhibits a maximum at small angles quantifying\nparticle's formation of spatial columns. We derive the droplet's collision\nkernel using that in the considered limit the gradients of droplet's flow are\nGaussian. We demonstrate that as Re increases the column's aspect ratio\ndecreases, eventually becoming one when the isotropy is restored.

Methods: The laterally integrated\ndepth-dose-distributions (IDDs) were acquired with the PTW Peakfinder, a\nvariable depth water column, equipped with two Bragg peak ionization chambers.\nFLUKA MC code was used to generate the energy libraries, the IDDs in water, and\nthe fragment spectra for carbon beams. EBT3 films were used for spot size\nmeasurements, beam position over the scan field, and homogeneity in 2D-fields.\nBeam monitor calibration was performed in terms of number of particles per MU\nusing both a Farmer-type and an Advanced Markus ionization chamber. The beam\nposition at the isocenter, beam monitor calibration curve, dose constancy in\nthe center of the spread-out-Bragg-peak, dose homogeneity in 2D-fields, beam\nenergy, spot size, and spot position over the scan field are all checked on a\ndaily basis for both protons and carbon ions and on all beam lines. Results:\nThe simulated IDDs showed an excellent agreement with the measured experimental\ncurves. The measured FWHM of the pencil beam in air at the isocenter was from\n0.7 to 2.2 cm for protons. For carbon ions, two sets of spot size are\navailable: from 0.4 to 0.8 cm (for the smaller) and from 0.8 to 1.1 cm (for the\nlarger one). The spot position was within +/-1 mm over the whole 20x20 cm2 scan\nfield; homogeneity in a uniform squared field was within +/-5% for both\nparticle types at any energy.

Recent research on Nb-Mo-Ta-W\nalloys points to a heightened role of edge dislocations on deformation, which\nis generally attributed to atomic-level chemical fluctuations in the material\nand their interactions with dislocation cores during slip. However, while this\nmodel accounts for a strengthening effect due to the chemical complexity of the\nalloy, it is not sufficient to explain its strength across the entire thermal\nrange. Here we propose a new mechanism that captures the existing theories\nabout enhanced lattice strengthening and a thermally-activated component that\nemanates directly from the chemical complexity of the RMEA. This compositional\ncomplexity results in unique vacancy formation energy distributions with tails\nthat extend into negative energies, leading to spontaneous, i.e., athermal,\nvacancy formation at edge dislocation cores. These vacancies relax into\natomic-sized super-jogs on the dislocation line, acting as extra pinning points\nthat increase the activation stress of the dislocation.

We observe Sagnac effect in a millimeter-scale wedged resonator\ngyroscope which has attracted considerable attention and been rapidly promoted\nin recent years. We demonstrate a bidirectional pump and probe scheme, which\ndirectly measures the frequency beat caused by the Sagnac effect. We establish\nthe linear response between the detected beat frequency and the rotation\nvelocity. The clockwise and counterclockwise rotation can also be distinguished\naccording to the value of the frequency beat. The experimental results verify\nthe feasibility of developing gyroscope in WGM resonator system and pave the\nway for future development.\n\n    "}
